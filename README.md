# A Proof of Concept for Akka and OSGi

## Overview

A simple test project to test creating an Akka v2.1-SNAPSHOT ActorSystem inside of an OSGi context.  Akka 2.1 will include OSGi support, bundling all of the subprojects.  This project is based on the [sbtosgi-examples](https://github.com/oscarvarto/sbtosgi-examples) project.

## Felix versus Karaf versus Equinox

Initially, I attempted to execute this application in Felix, but ran into issues with the exposing of sun.misc.Unsafe.  It is possible to configure Felix for bootdelegation of the package, but there is something wrong with the way akka.util.Unsafe is exposed at runtime, and I'm not sure how to get around that.  [Gert Vanthienen](https://github.com/gertv) was able to get tests of his pull requests into Akka for OSGi support to work with Karaf and no extra configuration, so I switched to Karaf as well.

For what it's worth, the shell in Karaf is so much nicer than Felix as well.  Felix has no history, no autocomplete and doesn't allow you to edit commands that you mistype.  Karaf has all of these features and is so much nicer to use.

I have not tried this under Equinox.

## Build and Bundle This Project

1. Clone this repo
2. Make sure you're using SBT v0.11.2 (required for the sbtosgi dependency)
2. At the command line at the root of the project, type "sbt"
3. At the sbt prompt, type "update compile osgi-bundle"

## Installing Karaf

How to install them is explained below.  This information is shamelessly stolen from the sbtosgi-example project referenced above, though altered to reflect the runtime and requirements of this project.

To download Apache Karaf, visit [this page](http://karaf.apache.org/index/community/download.html) and download the appropriate distribution for your environment.  Unzip it somewhere on your local drive, then go to that folder and start Karaf.
```
$ tar -xzf apache-karaf-2.2.7.tar.gz
$ cd apache-karaf-2.2.7
$ java -jar bin/karaf
```
You should see:
```
âžœ  apache-karaf-2.2.7  bin/karaf 
        __ __                  ____      
       / //_/____ __________ _/ __/      
      / ,<  / __ `/ ___/ __ `/ /_        
     / /| |/ /_/ / /  / /_/ / __/        
    /_/ |_|\__,_/_/   \__,_/_/

and '[cmd] --help' for help on a specific command.
Hit '<ctrl-d>' or 'osgi:shutdown' to shutdown Karaf.

## Start the OSGi Container and Install the Required Bundles

Before you install this bundle, you'll need to add library bundles for the Scala language library, Akka-Actor and Typesafe Config as dependencies.  See the lib folder for my pre-built artifacts, in case you don't want to build your own.  Note that the Akka bundle is a 2.1-SNAPSHOT as of revision "35aaa220aa0c65333e75a7c199fe9ebc782c1b89" on May 29, 2012, but the dependency on Typesafe Config has been changed to 0.4.2-SNAPSHOT.  Also, the Config is a 0.4.2-SNAPSHOT as of revision "b3ac8d0539d1df60ff3e5daaf5d619411f426f24" on May 24, 2012.  The Scala library is from my Scala IDE Eclipse distribution.

To see what bundles are currently running in the Karaf container:
```
g! lb
START LEVEL 1
   ID|State      |Level|Name
    0|Active     |    0|System Bundle (4.0.2)
    1|Active     |    1|Apache Felix Bundle Repository (1.6.6)
    2|Active     |    1|Apache Felix Gogo Command (0.12.0)
    3|Active     |    1|Apache Felix Gogo Runtime (0.10.0)
    4|Active     |    1|Apache Felix Gogo Shell (0.10.0)
```
Set the initial bundle level to 2, and move the framework level to that level right away.  For more information about bundle start levels, [see here](http://aaronz-sakai.blogspot.com/2009/05/osgi-system-and-bundle-start-levels.html).
```
g! bundlelevel -i 2
g! frameworklevel 2
```
Use `install` to load the bundles into the OSGi runtime, and then `start` them by bundle ID.  If you ever have to uninstall a bundle to replace it with a new version, use `uninstall` and the bundle ID to remove.
```
g! install file:///<path to felix-akka-example code>/lib/org.scala-ide.scala.compiler_2.9.2.v20120330-163119-949a4804e4-vfinal.jar
Bundle ID: 5
g! start 5
g! install file:///<path to felix-akka-example code>/lib/config-0.4.2-SNAPSHOT.jar
Bundle ID: 6
g! start 6
g! install file:///<path to felix-akka-example code>/lib/akka-actor-2.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
Bundle ID: 7
g! start 7
g! install file:///<path to felix-akka-example code>/target/scala-2.9.2/felix-akka-poc_2.9.2-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
Bundle ID: 8
g! start 8
```
Starting the Scala bundle will not actually start it, but it will resolve it.  If you look at the status of the bundle, you will see that it is merely `Resolved`, which is fine.  The OSGi context should look like this:
```
g! lb
START LEVEL 1
   ID|State      |Level|Name
    0|Active     |    0|System Bundle (4.0.2)
    1|Active     |    1|Apache Felix Bundle Repository (1.6.6)
    2|Active     |    1|Apache Felix Gogo Command (0.12.0)
    3|Active     |    1|Apache Felix Gogo Runtime (0.10.0)
    4|Active     |    1|Apache Felix Gogo Shell (0.10.0)
    5|Resolved   |    2|Scala Library for Eclipse (2.9.2.v20120330-163119-949a4804e4-vfinal)
    6|Active     |    2|com.typesafe.config (0.4.2.SNAPSHOT)
    7|Active     |    2|com.typesafe.akka.actor (2.1.0.SNAPSHOT)
    8|Active     |    2|default.Felix Akka POC (0.1.0.SNAPSHOT)
```
That's it.  If everything has gone correctly, you will see that the MyActor instance has received two messages with values of "2" and "foo".
